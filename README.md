# msa-proteins
CSCI 2820 final project 

Several pieces of code and intermediate data files are included in this repository. 

## Code written 
Here are general desciptions on each of the programs and their purpose. There are more detailed
comments within each file when necessary. 

### dcmp_analysis.py

This program analyses the DCMP files (Database for Cancer Mutant Proteins) to find the 
most common cancer mutant protein domains across various types of cancers. 

### uniprot-analysis.py

This program analyses the Uniprot sequences and groups them by protein domain to prepare
for Multiple Sequence Alignment. 

### make_files.sh

This program makes text files with the names of cancers to assist in organising data from DCMP. 

## Intermediate data
